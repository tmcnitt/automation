# Automation

Automation is a system for managing Z-Wave devices.

I wanted to be able to control several devices in my house (front lights, lamps, etc). The code runs on a raspberry pi and manages everything on a schedule.

## Features
 * Full scene and schedule support
 * Easy device integration (see library)
 * Controlled by HTTP API
 * Websocket support for updates
 * Basic react/redux frontend to control devices

## Built with
 * Golang
